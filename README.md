# Hi, I'm Dmytro 👋

📍 Principal Software Engineer in Test | 🤖 Building AI-powered QA tools | 🧪 Making quality engineering smarter

I'm passionate about building AI agents that help QA engineers focus on the product itself — automating the tedious parts so humans can do what they do best: think critically about quality.

## Current Projects

- 🔍 [playwright-ai-observer](https://github.com/dstekanov/playwright-ai-observer) — AI-powered visual QA observer for Playwright tests. Find UI bugs without baselines using GPT-4 Vision.
- 📊 [grafana-log-analyzer](https://github.com/dstekanov/grafana-log-analyzer) — CLI tool for analyzing Grafana Loki logs with AI agent integration. Granular analysis modes, token-efficient output, zero dependencies.
- 📈 [qa-dashboard](https://github.com/dstekanov/qa-dashboard) — Modern dashboard for visualizing QA test results with React, Material-UI, and a REST API.
- 🍎 [apple-health-ai](https://github.com/dstekanov/apple-health-ai) — Turn Apple Health exports into AI-readable markdown reports. Feed sleep, heart rate, training, and activity data into AI assistants for actionable health insights.
- ⭐ [awesome-sdet-collection](https://github.com/dstekanov/awesome-sdet-collection) — Curated list of tools, frameworks, and AI agent skills for SDETs.

## What I'm Doing

- Building AI agents that augment QA workflows — from visual testing to log analysis
- Exploring how LLMs can understand application behavior and surface real bugs
- Writing about SDET tooling and AI-assisted testing
